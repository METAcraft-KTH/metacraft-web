			<p>2. TYPES OF PROCESSED DATA</p>

			<p>
				We process various types of data, including information entered through the 'verify' command

				Discord servers. This may encompass email addresses, Discord usernames, Minecraft usernames,
				real names (first and last names), chat logs, and optional user-submitted text.

				information from the in-game 'verify' command (such as email and Minecraft usernames), are
				stored on our servers hosted by Hetzner Online GmbH, located in Helsinki, Finland.

			<p>3. PURPOSE OF DATA COLLECTION</p>

			<p>
				Our data collection serves multiple essential purposes. Its primary objective is to create a
				secure and inclusive environment while ensuring the efficient operation of our Minecraft and
				Discord servers. The information gathered is integral to upholding security measures and
				enabling seamless functionality of our servers. Additionally, it plays a critical role in
				proactively detecting and preventing cheating, hacking, or disruptions, thereby promoting
				fair play and improving the overall gaming experience for all users. We are dedicated to
				preserving the integrity of interactions and emphasising a positive user experience within
				our community.

				All personally identifiable GDPR-protected data are securely stored within the Google
				Workspace Drive of Konglig Datasektionen or on our server hosted by Hetzner. Access is
				limited to relevant Moderation team members for counteracting cheating or harassment or to
				the server admin for server management purposes. We maintain strict access controls to
				minimize exposure. General feedback data and player analytics may be collated, anonymized,
				and shared with METAcraft members.
			</p>

			<p>5. DATA RETENTION PERIOD</p>

			<p>
				We commit to promptly removing any contact details or other personally identifiable
				GDPR-protected data. At the latest, this information will be deleted within three weeks
				after the conclusion of METAcraft Season 3. Users can request explicit removal of their data
				at any time by contacting us using the provided email address or by opening a ticket on our
				Discord server.

				As a data subject, you have specific rights. You're entitled to be informed and can reach
				out to us with any queries. You have the right to request access to your data, rectify any
				inaccuracies, delete your data, or use it yourself, according to your own preferences.
